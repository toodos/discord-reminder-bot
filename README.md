## ✨ Core Operational Features

### 🤖 Autonomous AI Chat Interface
Communicate with the bot natively! Powered by Pollinations AI with a multi-model fallback strategy.
- **Smart Protocol Execution**: The bot can execute its own commands directly if you politely ask it (e.g., "Could you add 500 ₹ to @user?" or "Schedule a recharge in 10m").
- **Mention to Uplink**: Simply ping the bot or DM it to spark up a seamless, contextual connection!
- **Persistent Memory Bank**: The bot actively remembers details about users and the server context across conversations.
- **Administrative Security**: Sensitive AI execution tools (such as modifying balances, managing channels, and reading server logs) are strictly protected by role-based guardrails, ensuring only Administrators can execute administrative actions via the AI.

### 💰 Secure Economy System
Manage your server's funds efficiently with a reliable economic ledger.
- **Global Network Board**: See who the biggest contributors are.
- **Secure Vaults**: Every user has a personal Rupee (₹) balance.
- **Admin Adjustments**: Inject users with funds or deduct them to balance the ledger smoothly.

### 💳 UPI & QR Storage System
Store user UPI IDs securely in the unified database!
- **QR Code Storage**: Upload representations of QR codes directly to the bot. Image buffers are translated into Base64 strings and stored strictly in the database, requiring zero local file management.
- **Access Vault**: View saved user UPI information and QR code embeds effortlessly.

### 📋 Structured Ticket System
- **Support Departments**: Group tickets by purpose (e.g., Support, Bug Reports).
- **Interactive Terminals**: Open secure comms with a single button click.
- **Network Management**: Add or remove users from support threads using a polite interface.
- **Data Transcripts**: Automatically save an HTML archive of closed channels for your records.

### ⏰ Reminder & Recharge System
Never miss an operation with polite temporal pings and DMs!
- **Scheduled Alarms**: Set active reminders for yourself or others (e.g., `10m`, `1h`).
- **Recharge (Cooldowns)**: Put users into "recharge" mode to manage chat overload.
- **System Pings**: The bot sends a direct notification when the timer efficiently expires.
